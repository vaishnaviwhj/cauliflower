1.To begin making the Quick Cauliflower Sabzi Recipe, heat a teaspoon of oil in a pressure cooker. Add the  cumin seeds and allow it to crackle.

2.Add the ginger and onions, and saute until the onions soften.

3.Once the onions soften, add in the tomatoes, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, red chili powder, salt and stir until well combined for about a minute.

4.Finally stir in the cauliflower florets. Add about 2 to 3 tablespoons of water, cover the pressure cooker and pressure cook for only one whistle.

5.After the whistle turn off the heat and open the pressure cooker immediately. You will notice a semi gravy cauliflower sabzi. It's important to release the pressure immediately, as the cauliflower sabzi will get overcooked. 

6.The cauliflower sabzi will be soft, yet firm and delicious to taste. Finally stir in the coriander leaves and turn off heat. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.

7.Serve Quick Cauliflower Sabzi with Whole Wheat Lachha Paratha and Boondi Raita  for a simple and delicious lunch.
